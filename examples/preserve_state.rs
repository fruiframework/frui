//! This example shows how the order of children of a [`RenderWidget`]
//! affects whether the state of those children widgets will be preserved.
//!
//! [`RandomState`] is a widget that will generate and display a new number
//! every time its state has been reset. If you run this example you will be
//! able to notice that the state of [`RandomState`] widgets in each of the
//! [`Column`]s doesn't reset after you switch views (by clicking any key).
//!
//! This is because that [`RandomState`] in both of the views is a 3rd child.
//! Changing the order of that widget between children will ultimately cause
//! [`RandomState`] to lose its state.
//!
//! To avoid this, see `local_key` example which shows how you can annotate
//! stateful widgets in a way that will preserve their state even if their
//! order in children list changes.
